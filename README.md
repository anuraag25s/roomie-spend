📦 RoomieSpend (Roommate Grocery Expense Tracker)

Problem
International students and roommates struggle to track shared grocery expenses fairly. Existing tools like Splitwise don’t handle grocery-specific complexity (categories, receipts, partial usage, tax splitting).

Multi-household setup

Receipt upload (in-store + online)

Auto-categorization of Indian & US grocery items

Fair splitting based on usage

Tax distribution across items

Who It’s For

International students

Indian households in the US

Shared apartments (2–6 people)
