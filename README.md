# 🛒 Roommate Grocery Expense Tracker

A grocery-focused expense tracking app built from a **product manager’s lens**, optimized for shared households and international students.

---

## 🧩 The Problem

Living with roommates—especially as international students—means managing groceries together:
- Who bought what?
- Who uses which items?
- How do you fairly split shared vs personal groceries?
- How do you handle receipts, tax, and online orders?

Popular tools like Splitwise are **general-purpose** and break down when applied to groceries.  
They don’t understand:
- Grocery categories
- Partial usage
- Receipt-based logging
- Tax distribution
- Online vs in-store purchases

This led to confusion, friction, and unfair splits.

## 💡 The Solution

A **purpose-built grocery expense tracker** that:
- Is designed specifically for groceries
- Supports shared households
- Uses receipts as the primary input
- Minimizes manual entry
- Optimizes for fairness and clarity

Built using **AI-assisted development, no-code tools, and rapid iteration**, with a focus on real-world usability over technical perfection.
