Roommate Grocery Expense Tracker

---

## Problem Statement

Roommates struggle to fairly track and split grocery expenses due to:
- Mixed shared and personal items
- Inconsistent receipt formats
- Manual logging fatigue
- Tax not being accounted for properly
- Online orders spanning multiple screens

Existing tools are not designed for grocery-specific workflows.

---

## Goals

- Reduce friction in logging grocery expenses
- Ensure fairness and transparency
- Minimize manual input
- Support real household behavior

---

## Non-Goals

- ❌ Chore scheduling
- ❌ Cooking schedules
- ❌ Bill payments (rent, utilities)
- ❌ Social features or gamification

This product is **intentionally narrow**.
